# brainlack

This is a simple language for simple people! The language uses the following commands:

- `[`: Increment the value in the current memory cell.
- `]`: Decrement the value in the current memory cell.
- `*`: Double the value in the current memory cell.
- `,`: Triple the value in the current memory cell.
- `(`: Move the memory pointer to the right.
- `)`: Move the memory pointer to the left.
- `.`: Output the ASCII value in the current memory cell.
- `%`: Clear the memory.
- `#`: Clear the current selected memory cell.

The interpreter reads commands from a file and executes them one by one. If the file cannot be opened, the interpreter will print an error message and exit.
